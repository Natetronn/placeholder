===========

Placeholder allows you to easily add placeholder images to your site. Big deal right? Well, not really but, the nice thing about Placeholder is it currently combines 4 popular placeholder image servcies into one! You want cute kittens, no problem. You want dogs to chase the cute kittens, bark bark. Just need some generic non-image looking images, sure thing. How about a B&amp;W parasailer gliding over a scenic mountain-scape? Well, I'm not sure that's available but, it might be.
